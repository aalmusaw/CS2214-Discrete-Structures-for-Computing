# CS2214-Discrete-Structures-for-Computing
This repository contains my course work for an elementary Discrete Mathematics course offered by the University of Western Ontario. I took this course in January 2020.

All uploaded submissions are as is and not corrected if there are any problems. I have included grader feedback for each assignment.

**Note to students taking CS2214: If you decide to plagiarize, keep in mind that the Computer Science Department is aware of this repository. You will be caught.**
